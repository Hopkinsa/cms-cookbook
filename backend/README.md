# Cookbook Backend

## To install

From the repository root, change to the `backend` directory

```bash
$ npm install
```

## To run

Run `npm run start:dev` for a dev server.

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

Please note that starting it this way will not start the frontend server.
